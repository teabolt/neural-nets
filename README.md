# neural-nets

## Description
My attempt at learning about neural networks and associated topics.
Most of the code and understanding comes from Michael Nielsen's online book 'Neural networks and deep learning'.
The problem is to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
The code is to be tinkered with, modified, and extended.

## Key functionality and programs
* 'get_nets.py' generates, trains, and saves a neural net (just a shortcut to typing out many commands in the command line)
* 'data/own' contains own handwritten digits, outside of the MNIST data
